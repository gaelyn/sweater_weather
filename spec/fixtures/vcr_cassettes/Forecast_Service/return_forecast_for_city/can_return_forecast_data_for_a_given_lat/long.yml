        (i.e., gas or diesel) are now in effect until at least 4\np.m. Saturday, June

        designation, we request that\nactivities, such as driving non-ZEV vehicles
        (i.e., gas or\ndiesel), be reduced to lessen the impacts on neighboring air\nquality.
        Additional air pollution in this region may directly\nworsen air quality or
        contribute to precursors which may also\nadversely affect air quality.  For
